This was live from 2010-2013. It was a hobby project / labor of love. About 100 players at its max. Fun while it lasted. 

Uploading to code for historical purposes. For the record, it was built with Railo/CFML. The framework was FW/1, by seancorfield. Front end was bootstrap 2. We hosted at AWS at the time.
