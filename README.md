# Sharp League

Sharp League was a wagering tournament using fake money. It was like fantasy football, but better. That was the tag line anyway. 

This was live from 2010-2014. It was a hobby project / labor of love. About 200 players at its max. Fun while it lasted. 

Uploading the codebase for historical purposes. For the record, this was built with [Railo](https://github.com/getrailo/railo), a CFML engine. The framework was [FW/1](https://github.com/framework-one/fw1), by seancorfield. Front end was bootstrap 2, which you already know. We hosted at AWS at the time. I drank a lot of plantation spearmint tea.
